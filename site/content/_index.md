title: Email Verification directly on Google Sheets
---
Email Verification Add-on prevents bounced emails and low-quality contacts because:

* It provides a real-time validation lookup directly on Google Sheets. You receive fresh data upon request and don’t need to export/import contacts for the verification process.
* It shows you non-deliverable email addresses.

#### Common questions

**How do you validate the data?**

We have built a service to carry out validation at different levels: an address format, information about a domain, it's mail server, and a response from that mail server. The add-on is connected to the service via API.

**How can I be sure that you will not steal my data?**

For security reasons and in order to protect your data, we do not collect (or share data) from your validation lookups on our servers. We don’t even have a database to store data.

**What message shows me that my email will not be bounced?**

The «deliverable» message is what you need. It shows that a mail server accepted email sent to this email address.
