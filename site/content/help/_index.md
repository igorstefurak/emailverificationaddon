#### How to use the add-on for email verification?

* Launch it Add-ons -> Email Verification -> Start.
* Click **Create headers** to understand data.
* Paste a list of email addresses into the 1st column.

* Wait a few seconds to get results.

#### How can I increase my amount of quota?

* Open Settings: Add-ons -> Email Verification -> Settings.
* Choose the amount you want to increase your quota by.
* Pay securely with Stripe.

#### What do the statuses mean?

«Deliverable (catch-all server)» means the email server receives emails sent to any email address under that domain. Be aware, there is a risk you can get under a spam filter.

«No response from this mail server» means the email server doesn't respond at the moment because of any of the things: it is down right now or it is slowed down. You can check it again later.

«Not deliverable» means the email address doesn't exist.

#### Do you have a demo video on how to use the add-on?
