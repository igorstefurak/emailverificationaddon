#### What do result columns mean?

1. «Is deliverable?» column shows if an email is deliverable or not.
2. «Host status» column shows if a domain exists and a mail server is reachable at all.
3. «Inbox status» column shows if an email inbox is full or empty.
4. «Catching-all status» column shows if a domain has a catch-all address associated with it (if it will catch all of the emails addressed to the domain that does not exist in the mail server).

#### How can I increase my amount of quota?

* Open Settings: Add-ons -> Email Verification Add-on -> Settings.
* Choose the amount you want to increase your quota by.
