«Deliverable» means you can send the email without a risk.

«Deliverable (catch-all server)» means the email server receives emails sent to any email address under that domain. Be aware, there is a risk you can get under a spam filter.

«The mail server doesn't respond» means the target mail server either does not respond or takes too long to respond. You can check it again later.

«Not deliverable» means the email address doesn’t exist.
